How to install this mod:

First, place the .big file in the data folder in your Homeworld2 installation directory:

For example: C:\Program Files\Sierra\Homeworld2\data\EnhancedOptions.big
If you are using Steam, the path is more likely as follows: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Homeworld\Homeworld2Classic\data\EnhancedOptions.big"

Second, duplicate your desktop shortcut, right click the new shortcut and add the following to "Target" box:

-mod EnhancedOptions.big

If you also want to play in UHD resolution, also add this:

-h 2160 -w 3840

The whole thing should then look as follows:

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Homeworld\Homeworld2Classic\bin\Release\Homeworld2.exe" -mod EnhancedOptions.big -h 2160 -w 3840

Use this shortcut to play the mod.
